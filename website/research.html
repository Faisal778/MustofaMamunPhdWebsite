                <h5><strong> Abstract: </strong></h5>
                Government spending, one of the major components of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), is
                composed of government consumption, investment, and transfer payments. A change in
                government spending during recessionary periods can generate an increase in GDP greater than
                the increase in spending. This is called the "multiplier effect". Accurate estimation of government
                spending multiplier is important because fiscal policy has been used to stimulate a flagging
                economy. Many recent studies have focused on identifying parts of economy that responds more
                to a stimulus under variety of circumstances. I use the US dataset from 1966 to 2020 and a linear
                Vector Auto Regression (VAR) model assuming standard identification method (Blanchard &
                Perotti 2002) to estimate the multipliers. I include private consumption, private investment in the
                model and control for forecasted government spending, interest rate, Consumer Price Index (CPI),
                export, import, and level of public debt. I find the investment multipliers to be positive for the first
                five quarters and larger than one around impact whereas consumption multiplier is not significantly
                different than zero. It is because an increase in public consumption crowds out private investment
                whereas an increase in public investment does not crowd out private consumption or investment.
                In addition, much of the positive and prolonged effects of public investment shock on GDP are
                seen during the expansionary periods. Surprisingly, both these results are not consistent with the
                traditional theories or findings from prominent literature on this topic.

                identifying parts of economy that responds more to a stimulus under variety of circumstances. This paper
                used the US dataset from 1966 to 2020 and local projection method assuming standard identification
                strategy to estimate the multipliers. The model includes important macro aggregates and controls for
                forecasted government spending, interest rate, Consumer Price Index (CPI), export, import, and level of
                public debt. Investment multipliers are found to be positive and larger than the consumption
                multipliers. Consumption multipliers are either negative or not significantly different than zero.
                Results do not vary across the business cycle. However, consumption multiplier estimated from pre-1980
                data is positive.

                <h5><strong> Abstract: </strong></h5>
                Government spending, one of the major components of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), is
                composed of government consumption, investment, and transfer payments. Fiscal stimulus is
                additional government spending to stimulate economic activity whereas fiscal austerity is a cut in
                government spending to limit the budget deficit. The fiscal multiplier measures the change in a
                countryâ€™s GDP due to a change in government spending. Many recent studies have focused on
                identifying parts of economy that responds more to a stimulus under variety of circumstances. The
                type of government spending, persistence of the change in spending, and how it is financed have
                been found to affect the size of multipliers. I use the dataset from the Bureau of Economic Analysis
                for the USA from 1947 to 2019 and a linear Vector Auto Regression (VAR) model with standard
                Blanchard-Perotti specification to estimate the multiplier. I find it to be approximately one for
                full
                sample.1 Then, I divide the dataset into two samples and found multiplier is larger when the
                economy is in the recession. This provides evidence that fiscal stimulus is more effective during
                the time of recession. However, since this model assumes linearity between the variables,
                symmetry of responses of the economy to an increase in spending during recessions and
                expansions as well as a specific underlying relationship it may over or under-estimate the true size
                of the multiplier. Recent studies use non-parametric methods to compute multipliers.
                Nonparametric models provide more accurate estimation of fiscal multiplier. Hence, I will adopt
                non-parametric approach in this research to estimate the effects of fiscal stimulus.
